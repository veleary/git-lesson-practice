Paragraph 1

Today is my first day at MakerSquare. I'm so nervous, anxious, and excited about the next 10 weeks! What if I don't get along with my pair? What if I can't keep up with the pace of the class? What if I fall behind? What if it's too easy? What if I can't physically handle the work? What if my new classmates and I don't get along? Oh boy so many "What if's."

Paragraph 2

But then again, what if I absolutely love my new classmates? What if this programming stuff really isn't so bad after all? What if my teachers are amazing? What if I'm having "ah-ha!" moments left and left? What if I can build anything I want? What if I walk out of here being bff's with everyone I meet? What if this is the first time ever that I find myself absolutely loving school?
